# IOT Weather Indicator
I am working an IOT Weather Indicator. This project will grab weather from the internet using API's and will display them on a small screen.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was coding a script in Arduino that would allow my ESP32 to connect to the wifi, grab API's off the internet, and then give me the temperature. First up was connecting my ESP32. All I did was plug a micro-usb charger into my computer and then I connected the charger to my ESP32. Next I downloaded the ESP32 Drivers and the Arduino application. I then watched a tutorial on how to connect an ESP32 board to the Arduino app. [Connecting ESP32](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/) Then, I connected my ESP32 to wifi using this video. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klIBePOzXpo&ab_channel=Techtutorialsx) After connecting my ESP32 to wifi, I then got my API's from this website (https://openweathermap.org/api) and then used a get request to get those API's (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_2cw0k6lgs&t=11s&ab_channel=Techtutorialsx). After I got the API's I had to deserialize it and make it legible following this tutorial(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfr6wddRRxo&ab_channel=BenoitBlanchon). Now my code gets the weather and it is really accurate.
